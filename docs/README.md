# as-app3d: AgentScript Three.js App

This is an app or framework for [AgentScript](https://github.com/backspaces/agentscript). AgentScript itself has no View, it is Model only, in a Model/View architecture. Here we add a tightly integrated Three.js View by extending AgentScript via subclassing

Because this contains both a Model and View, as-app3d is more like [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) who's semantics AgentScript is based on.

Note: Our future plan is a suite of several Views which are less tightly bound to AgentScript. The Three version will be as-view3d.

## Dual Build

as-app3d is based on es6 Modules (ESM) which are delivered as two [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) bundles:

```
* UMD: as-app3d.umd.js
* ESM: as-app3d.esm.js
```

The UMD can be used in the browser as a `<script>` tag, and in Node using `require()`

The ESM is used in es6 import statements.

Both are available in minified form. All are in the project's `dist/` directory.

The UMD's global name is `ASapp3d`

## NPM Package
as-app3d is available as a npm *scoped* package: @redfish/as-app3d.

To install the package, `yarn add @redfish/as-app3d`. This places the bundles in `node_modules/@redfish/as-app3d/dist`

To use the package as a CDN, use [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/).
* UMD: [https://unpkg.com/@redfish/as-app3d](https://unpkg.com/@redfish/as-app3d)
* ESM: [https://unpkg.com/@redfish/as-app3d?module](https://unpkg.com/@redfish/as-app3d?module)

## Developer Information

To clone the github repo:
* cd to where you want the as-app3d/ dir to appear.
* git clone https://github.com/backspaces/as-app3d
* cd as-app3d # go to new repo
* yarn install # install all dev dependencies
* yarn build # complete the install

All workflow is npm run scripts.  See package.json's scripts, or use `yarn run` for a list. [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) is [used](https://github.com/backspaces/as-app3d/blob/master/.eslintrc.json).

## Github Pages

A [gh-page](http://backspaces.github.io/as-app3d/) is used for the site. It contains the dist/ dir and a models/ dir with sample models also used for testing.

It uses [the docs/ simplification](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages) for gh-page creation.

The gh-page hosts our sample models. The fire model can be run with:
> http://backspaces.github.io/as-app3d/models?fire

The Github page can be used as a CDN for experimental use:

*   UMD: [https://backspaces.github.io/as-app3d/dist/as-app3d.umd.js](https://backspaces.github.io/agentscript/dist/agentscript.umd.js)
*   ESM: [https://backspaces.github.io/as-app3d/dist/as-app3d.esm.js](https://backspaces.github.io/as-app3d/dist/as-app3d.esm.js)
